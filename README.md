# CodeGen

### Why
	- I am sick and tired of writing the same code over and over again.  
	- I am also sick and tired of writing code generators over and over again.
	- This one should end it all (famous last words!)
		
### How to use it
	- Powershell was my original choice. But I have come to realized that it was a bad one.  
	There is no automation need for code gen.  This is created purely to speed up development.  
	Typing the same command over and over again is not very speedy.
	- The next choice is a WPF UI - Albatross.CodeGen.Shell.  The developer should be able to 
	setup code gen scenarios using the UI so that repeat generation will be as quick as a alt 
	tab switch and F5.
	
### Coverage
	- CRUD operations for SQL tables.
	- Dapper Command Definitions for Stored Procedures.
	- Creating WPF View Models from POCO objects
	- WebApi C# Proxy Generation
	- The Albatross.CodeGen will be available in NuGet so that people can create their own scenarios.
